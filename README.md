# Welcome to 100daysofstatistics

Hi! I am Mike Watts, a programmer that challenged himself to study statistics for the next 100 days. If  you are interested in it, let's follow along!

### Learning process
- You write the code. Boilerplate is on me
- Real world problems and datasets
- Hard and eerie stuff when we need it
- Statistics used as a tool
- No basics and corny stuff (what **mean** or **median** and so on is). If you are a completely beginner, I highly recommend to check the [cheatsheet]()

### How to start?
- Make sure the [anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) is installed
- Clone this repo by typing `git clone github.com/awarebayes/100daysofstatistics` in the console
- Type `jupyter-notebook` and navigate to the location where the project was cloned
- Go ahead into the src folder and solve the first day problem

### Contents
- [1] **Naive Bayes**: z-scores, bayes theorem
